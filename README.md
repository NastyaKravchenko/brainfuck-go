This compiler can be used in the command line. On the command line side, this interpreter can be stored as a quasi-executable, like gcc.

Run main, pass in BF source files as args. Source files should end with extensions .b or .bf
Example:
./main hello.bf
interprets and optimizes hello.bf before computing the logic. Input is retrieved from stdin and Output pushed to stdout.
